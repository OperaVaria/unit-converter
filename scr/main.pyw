Unit Converter for Historical Studies

This Python app is a simple converter for historical measurement units. For the moment, the app it is only available
with a Hungarian UI, and features historical unit systems mainly associated with Austria and Hungary, as well as the
Ancient Greek and Roman measurements. However, any unit system can be implemented. All modern metric and Anglo-American
units are added for reference. The converter uses the Tkinter GUI toolkit with ttk widgets, the unit database was
built with the SQLite database engine.

NB. This is my first ever coding project in any language.

TODO: 1. Lost of testing, bug hunting, typo fixing.
      2. Add more unit systems.
      3. Possibly add coin weights.
      4. Implement multi-language GUI.
