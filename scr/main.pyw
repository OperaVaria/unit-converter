Unit Converter for Historical Studies

This Python app is a simple converter for historical measurement units. At the moment it has a Hungarian UI,
and features historical unit systems mainly associated with Austria and Hungary, as well as the Ancien Greek
and Roman measurements. However, any unit system can be implemented. All modern metric and Anglo-American units are
added for reference. The converter uses the Tkinter GUI toolkit with ttk widgets.

NB. This is my first ever coding project in any language.

TODO: 1. Lost of testing, bug hunting, typo fixing.
      2. Add more unit systems, especially volume.
      3. Possibly implement an info page for more background information on
         units and unit systems.
      4. Possibly add coin weights.
      5. Convert the unit database to a more suitable file type.
      6. More appealing ttk theming.
      7. Implement multi-language GUI.
